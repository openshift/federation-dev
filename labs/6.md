## Kubeconfig
Specific items are required to be configured within the `kubeconfig` file before
federating clusters. By default the context is defined as *admin* in the `kubeconfig` file for OpenShift
4 clusters.  The directories below east-1, east-2, and west-2 represent the directories
containing independent OpenShift 4 clusters and the `kubconfig` relating to those OpenShift deployments.
Your cluster names may be different.
~~~sh
sed -i 's/admin/east1/g' east-1/auth/kubeconfig
sed -i 's/admin/east2/g' east-2/auth/kubeconfig
sed -i 's/admin/west2/g' west-2/auth/kubeconfig
export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/east-1/auth/kubeconfig:`pwd`/east-2/auth/kubeconfig:`pwd`/west-2/auth/kubeconfig
oc config view --flatten > aws-east1-east2-west2
export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/aws-east1-east2-west2
oc config set-context east1

## Install the kubefedctl binary

The `kubefedctl` tool manages federated cluster registration. Download the
v0.0.10 release and unpack it into a directory in your PATH (the
example uses `$HOME/bin`):

NOTE: The version may change as the operator matures. Verify that the version of
Federation matches the version of `kubefedctl`.

~~~sh
curl -LOs https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/releases/download/v0.0.10/kubefedctl.tgz
tar xzf kubefedctl.tgz -C ~/bin
rm -f kubefedctl.tgz
~~~

Verify that `kubefedctl` is working:
~~~sh
kubefedctl version

kubefedctl version: version.Info{Version:"v0.0.10-dirty", GitCommit:"71d233ede685707df554ef653e06bf7f0229415c", GitTreeState:"dirty", BuildDate:"2019-05-06T22:30:31Z", GoVersion:"go1.11.2", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

## Joining Clusters
Now that the `kubefedctl` binary has been acquired the next step is joining the clusters.
`kubefedctl` binary utilizes the contexts and clusters within `kubeconfig` when defining the clusters.

Using the `kubeconfig` file that was generated, verify the Operator has been successfully deployed.
~~~sh
$ oc get csv -n federated-mongo
NAME                DISPLAY      VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
federation.v0.0.10   Federation   0.0.10                Succeeded
~~~
The next step is to federate the clusters using `kubefedctl`.
~~~sh
kubefedctl join east1 --host-cluster-context east1 --add-to-registry --v=2 --federation-namespace=federated-mongo
kubefedctl join east2 --host-cluster-context east1 --add-to-registry --v=2 --federation-namespace=federated-mongo
kubefedctl join west2 --host-cluster-context east1 --add-to-registry --v=2 --federation-namespace=federated-mongo

for type in namespaces deployments.apps ingresses.extensions secrets serviceaccounts services persistentvolumeclaims configmaps
do
  kubefedctl enable $type --federation-namespace federated-mongo
done
~~~

Validate that the clusters are defined as `federatedclusters`.
~~~sh
oc get federatedclusters -n federated-mongo
NAME    READY
east1   True
east2   True
west2   True
~~~

# Red Hat Tech Exchange Lab - Hands on with Red Hat Multi-Cluster Federation: Application Portability

This page contains a series of labs to be conducted during Red Hat Tech exchange.

During the labs you will be deploying some federated workloads on three OpenShift 4 clusters that have been pre-deployed for you.

If during the labs you need to start over check out the [cleanup instructions](./cleanup-instructions.md)

You will be using some helper scripts during the labs, below a reference table:

| Helper Script             | Description                                                                                            | When should I use it?                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| init-lab                  | Backups the current lab folder and download the lab again so student can start over                    | Only if requested by the instructor          |
| gen-mongo-certs           | Generates the required certificates for MongoDB on Lab5                                                | Only if requested by the instructor          |
| namespace-cleanup         | Deletes everything inside the namespace sent as parameter and the namespace itself from all clusters   | Only if you need to start a lab from scratch |
| wait-for-deployment       | Waits until a given deployment in a given cluster and namespace is ready (all replicas up and running) | When required by instructions                |
| wait-for-mongo-replicaset | Waits until the MongoDB ReplicaSet is configured in a given cluster and namespace                      | When required by instructions                |
| argocd-add-clusters       | Adds all clusters to Argo CD using a workaround to avoid colliding secrets error                       | When required by instructions                |

# Introduction

This demo is a simple deployment of [Federation Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/alpha/federation.v0.0.10) on two OpenShift
clusters. A sample application is deployed to both clusters through the Federation controller.

The files within this directory are used with the Federation operator to show
MongoDB running on multiple OpenShift clusters. An accompanying video
is [here](https://youtu.be/StNJupmZ5Mo). This demonstration uses 3 OpenShift 4 clusters. It is assumed that 3 OpenShift
clusters have already been deployed using of the deployment mechanisms defined at
https://cloud.openshift.com.

# Prerequisites

The Federation Operator requires at least one [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/) 4.1 cluster.

This walkthrough will use 2 OCP 4.1 clusters deployed using the [developer preview on AWS](https://cloud.openshift.com/clusters/install).

## Install the kubefedctl binary

The `kubefedctl` tool manages federated cluster registration. Download the
v0.0.10 release and unpack it into a directory in your PATH (the
example uses `$HOME/bin`):

~~~sh
curl -LOs https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/releases/download/v0.0.10/kubefedctl.tgz
tar xzf kubefedctl.tgz -C ~/bin
rm -f kubefedctl.tgz
~~~

Verify that `kubefedctl` is working:

~~~sh
kubefedctl version

kubefedctl version: version.Info{Version:"v0.0.10-dirty", GitCommit:"71d233ede685707df554ef653e06bf7f0229415c", GitTreeState:"dirty", BuildDate:"2019-05-06T22:30:31Z", GoVersion:"go1.11.2", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
~~~

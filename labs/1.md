# Introduction

This hands on lab is a simple deployment of [Kubefed Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/kubefed-operator) on multiple OpenShift
clusters. This lab will use the KubeFed operator above as well as the binary `kubefedctl`.
We will deploy cluster scoped KubeFed and deploy applications to multiple clusters using KubeFed Primitives.

# Prerequisites
Three OpenShift clusters have already been deployed for use in this lab. During
this lab we will utilize the `kubefedctl` binary to join the three clusters
as well as enable the required types and then use the `oc` command to deploy objects used for the lab.

## Install the kubefedctl binary

The `kubefedctl` tool manages federated cluster registration. Download the
v0.1.0 release and unpack it into a directory in your PATH (the
example uses `$HOME/bin`):

~~~sh
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/releases/download/v0.1.0-rc4/kubefedctl-0.1.0-rc4-linux-amd64.tgz
tar xzf kubefedctl-0.1.0-rc4-linux-amd64.tgz -C ~/bin
rm -f kubefedctl-0.1.0-rc4-linux-amd64.tgz
~~~

Verify that `kubefedctl` is working:

~~~sh
kubefedctl version

kubefedctl version: version.Info{Version:"v0.1.0-rc4-dirty", GitCommit:"2dbec10d6bef12ebcd21744ccb50eb4e8cfcfeaa", GitTreeState:"dirty", BuildDate:"2019-07-19T23:38:14Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

# Introduction and Prerequisites

This hands on lab is a deployment of [Argo CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) which will be used to manage multiple OpenShift
clusters. This lab will use the Argo CD above as well as the binary `argocd`.

# Accessing the ClientVM
All of the work will be completed using the ClientVM that you get from GuidGrabber for Cluster1 Environment. Let's go ahead an login into the ClientVM. Remember that login details are presented by GuidGrabber.

e.g:

![SSH Details GuidGrabber](assets/ssh-details-gg.png)

For *sshing* in the ClientVM you can use your favorite ssh-client.

~~~sh
ssh student@clientvm.GUID.DOMAIN

e.g: ssh student@clientvm.d5fe.sandbox253.opentlc.com
~~~

At this point you should be logged in to the ClientVM and you should have the information for all three environment defined by the GuidGrabber.

During this lab we will utilize the `argocd` binary to define the clusters and repositories in which the Argo CD deployment will manage. 

We will use [cfssl tooling](https://cfssl.org/) when dealing with TLS certificates, `cfssl` and `cfssljson` binaries are already deployed for you.

# Application Portability
The strength of KubeFed is the ability to mange application workloads and move applications between clusters.

## Moving the Application
By patching the `federateddeployment` the application can be scheduled and unscheduled between the clusters. The step below scales to 0 the *pacman* application deployment from all clusters except for cluster2. This is done by modifying the `federateddeployment`
~~~sh
oc --context=cluster1 -n pacman patch federateddeployment pacman --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":[{"clusterName":"cluster3","clusterOverrides":[{"path":"/spec/replicas","value":0}]},{"clusterName":"cluster1","clusterOverrides":[{"path":"/spec/replicas","value":0}]}]}}'
~~~

The above command states that there should be 0 replicas in both cluster1 and cluster3. To verify
no pods are running in the other clusters the following command can be ran.

~~~sh
oc get deployment pacman --context cluster1 -n pacman
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pacman   0/0     0            0           132m

oc get deployment pacman --context cluster2 -n pacman
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pacman   1/1     1            1           132m


oc get deployment pacman --context cluster3 -n pacman
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pacman   0/0     0            0           132m
~~~

To populate the application back to all clusters remove the overrides created in the previous step.
~~~sh
oc --context=cluster1 -n pacman patch federateddeployment pacman --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":[]}}'
~~~

Another approach will be modifying the *pacman* application deployment placement. This is done by modifying the `federateddeployment`
~~~sh
oc --context=cluster1 -n pacman patch federateddeployment pacman --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"placement":{"clusters": [{"name":"cluster2"}]}}}'
~~~

The above commands states that the Pacman deployment should be present only in cluster2. To verify no deployments
are available in the other clusters the following command can be ran.

~~~sh
oc get deployment pacman --context cluster1 -n pacman
No resources found.

oc get deployment pacman --context cluster2 -n pacman
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pacman   1/1     1            1           132m

oc get deployment pacman --context cluster3 -n pacman
No resources found.
~~~

To populate the application back to all clusters, modify the placement to include cluster1 and cluster2.
~~~sh
oc --context=cluster1 -n pacman patch federateddeployment pacman --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"placement":{"clusters": [{"name":"cluster1"}, {"name":"cluster2"}, {"name":"cluster3"}]}}}'
~~~

Can you spot the difference between scaling a deployment to 0 in a cluster using `overrides` and removing a deployment from a cluster using `placement`?


The most important thing to note during the modification of which clusters are running the
*pacman* application is that the scores persist regardless of which cluster the application is running and HAProxy always ensures the application is available.

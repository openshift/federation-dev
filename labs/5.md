# Federated MongoDB
The files within this directory are used with the Federation operator to show
MongoDB running on multiple OpenShift clusters. An accompanying video
is [here](https://youtu.be/StNJupmZ5Mo). This demonstration uses 3 OpenShift 4 clusters. It is assumed that 3 OpenShift
clusters have already been deployed using of the deployment mechanisms defined at
https://cloud.openshift.com.

## Creating a Namespace and Deploying the Operator
The first step is to decide which of the clusters will run the Federation Operator.
Only one cluster runs the federation-controller-manager.

A new project of *federated-mongo* is created within the OpenShift UI on cluster east1. Once the project is created the next step is to deploy the operator.

Select OperatorHub</br>

Once Federation has been chosen, information about the Operator will appear. It is
important to take note of the Operator Version as this will be needed when deciding
which version of Kubefedctl to use.

Select Install</br>

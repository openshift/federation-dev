# Example application

Now that we have federation installed, let’s deploy an example app in both
clusters through the federation control plane.

Verify that our test-namespace is present in both clusters now:

~~~sh
oc --context=cluster1 get ns | grep test-namespace
oc --context=cluster2 get ns | grep test-namespace

test-namespace                 Active    36m
test-namespace                 Active    3m21s
~~~

The container image we will use for our example application (nginx) requires the
ability to choose its user id. Configure the clusters to grant that privilege:

~~~sh
for c in cluster1 cluster2; do
    oc --context ${c} \
        adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid \
        system:serviceaccount:test-namespace:default
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-deploy-the-application" name="deploy-the-application"></a>
## Deploy the application

The sample application includes the following resources:

-   A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) of an nginx web server.
-   A [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) of type NodePort for nginx.
-   A sample [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/), [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) and [ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/). These are not actually used by
    the sample application (static nginx) but are included to illustrate how
    Kubefed would assist with more complex applications.

The [sample-app directory](./sample-app) contains definitions to deploy these resources. For each of them there is a resource template and a placement policy, and some of
them also have overrides. For example: the [sample nginx deployment template](./sample-app/federateddeployment.yaml)
specifies 3 replicas, but there is also an override that sets the replicas to 5
on `cluster2`.

Instantiate all these federated resources:

~~~sh
oc apply -R -f sample-app
~~~

<a id="markdown-verify-that-the-application-is-running" name="verify-that-the-application-is-running"></a>
## Verify that the application is running

Verify that the various resources have been deployed in both clusters according
to their respective placement policies and cluster overrides:

~~~sh
for resource in configmaps secrets deployments services; do
    for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
        echo ------------ ${cluster} ${resource} ------------
        oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get ${resource}
    done
done
~~~

Verify that the application can be accessed:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
  echo ------------ ${cluster} ------------
  oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace expose service test-service
  url="http://$(oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get route test-service -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
  curl -I $url
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-modify-placement" name="modify-placement"></a>
## Modify placement

Now modify the `test-deployment` federated deployment placement policy to remove `cluster2`, leaving it
only active on `cluster1`:

~~~sh
oc -n test-namespace patch federateddeployment test-deployment \
    --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"placement":{"clusterNames": ["cluster1"]}}}'
~~~

Observe how the federated deployment is now only present in `cluster1`:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
    echo ------------ ${cluster} deployments ------------
    oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get deployments
done
~~~

Now add `cluster2` back to the federated deployment placement:

~~~sh
oc -n test-namespace patch federateddeployment test-deployment \
    --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"placement":{"clusterNames": ["cluster1", "cluster2"]}}}'
~~~

And verify that the federated deployment was deployed on both clusters again:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
    echo ------------ ${cluster} deployments ------------
    oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get deployments
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-clean-up" name="clean-up"></a>
# Clean up

To clean up the test application run:

~~~sh
oc delete -R -f sample-app
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
  oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace delete route test-service
done
~~~

This leaves the two clusters with federation deployed. If you want to disable federation:

1. Login into `cluster1` web console as `kubeadmin` user
   1. Login details were reported by the installer
2. Ensure the active project is `test-namespace`
3. Delete the CVS (Cluster Service Version)
   1. On the left panel click `Catalog -> Installed Operators`
   2. Click the three dots icon on the federation entry
   3. Click `Delete Cluster Service Version`

This walkthrough does not go into detail about the components and resources involved
in cluster federation. Feel free to explore the repository to review the YAML files
that configure Federation and deploy the sample application. See also the upstream
ke REubefed repository and its [user guide](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/userguide.md), on which this guide is based.

Beyond that: More advanced aspects of cluster federation
like managing ingress traffic or storage rely on supporting infrastructure for
the clusters will be topics for more advanced guides.

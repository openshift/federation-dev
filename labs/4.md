# Example application One

Now that we have federation installed, letâ€™s deploy an example app in the
clusters through the KubeFed control plane.

The `test-namespace` namespace must be created and then defined as a federated namespace.
~~~sh
oc create ns test-namespace
kubefedctl federate namespace test-namespace
~~~

Verify that our test-namespace is present in all three clusters now:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2 cluster3; do
  oc --context=${cluster} get ns test-namespace
done

test-namespace                 Active    36m
test-namespace                 Active    3m21s
test-namespace                 Active    4m21s
~~~

The container image we will use for our example application (nginx) requires the
ability to choose its user id. Configure the clusters to grant that privilege:

~~~sh
for c in cluster1 cluster2 cluster3; do
    oc --context ${c} \
        adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid \
        system:serviceaccount:test-namespace:default
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-deploy-the-application" name="deploy-the-application"></a>
## Deploy the application

The sample application includes the following resources:

-   A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) of an nginx web server.
-   A [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) of type NodePort for nginx.
-   A sample [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/), [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) and [ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/). These are not actually used by
    the sample application (static nginx) but are included to illustrate how
    KubeFed would assist with more complex applications.

The [sample-app directory](./sample-app) contains definitions to deploy these resources. For each of them there is a resource template and a placement policy, and some of
them also have overrides. For example: the [sample nginx deployment template](./sample-app/federateddeployment.yaml)
specifies 3 replicas, but there is also an override that sets the replicas to 5
on `cluster2`.

Instantiate all these federated resources:

~~~sh
oc apply -R -f sample-app/
~~~

<a id="markdown-verify-that-the-application-is-running" name="verify-that-the-application-is-running"></a>
## Verify that the application is running

Verify that the various resources have been deployed in both clusters according
to their respective placement policies and cluster overrides:

~~~sh
for resource in configmaps secrets deployments services; do
    for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
        echo ------------ ${cluster} ${resource} ------------
        oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get ${resource}
    done
done
~~~

Verify that the application can be accessed:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
  echo ------------ ${cluster} ------------
  oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace expose service test-service
  url="http://$(oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get route test-service -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
  curl -I $url
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-modify-placement" name="modify-placement"></a>
## Modify placement

Now modify the `test-deployment` federated deployment placement policy to remove `cluster2`, leaving it
only active on `cluster1`:

~~~sh
oc -n test-namespace patch federateddeployment test-deployment \
    --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"placement":{"clusters": [{"name":"cluster1"}]}}}'
~~~

Observe how the federated deployment is now only present in `cluster1`:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
    echo ------------ ${cluster} deployments ------------
    oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get deployments
done
~~~

Now add `cluster2` back to the federated deployment placement:

~~~sh
oc -n test-namespace patch federateddeployment test-deployment \
    --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"placement":{"clusters": [{"name":"cluster1"}, {"name":"cluster2"}]}}}'
~~~

And verify that the federated deployment was deployed on both clusters again:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
    echo ------------ ${cluster} deployments ------------
    oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get deployments
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-clean-up" name="clean-up"></a>
# Clean up

To clean up the test application run:

~~~sh
oc delete -R -f sample-app/
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
  oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace delete route test-service
done
~~~

To clean up the `test-namespace` namespace run:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2 cluster3; do
  oc --context=${cluster} delete namespace test-namespace
done
~~~

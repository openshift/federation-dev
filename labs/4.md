# Deploying and Managing a Project with GitOps 

Now that we have the clusters defined, letâ€™s deploy a project which includes a service, namespace, and deployment.

This lab will use cluster1 only. The first step is to ensure that no resources currently exist in the *simple-app* namespace.
~~~sh
# Use the `oc` command to list deployments
oc --context cluster1 -n simple-app get deployment

No resources found.
~~~

<a id="markdown-deploy-the-application" name="deploy-the-application"></a>
## Deploy the application

The simple application we are using is an Apache web server serving a default index page.

The simple application includes the following resources:

-   A [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) for the deployment and service.
-   A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) of Apache web server.
-   A [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

The [lab-4-assets](./lab-4-assets) contains definitions to deploy these resources.
For example: the [simple Apache deployment template](./lab-4-assets/deployment.yaml)

The assets will be loaded into Argo CD to be deployed and managed.

1. Change directory to `lab-4-assets` to see the assets to be created.

    ~~~sh
    cd ~/federation-dev/labs/lab-4-assets
    ~~~
2. Load the git repository and path into Argo CD

    ~~~sh
    argocd repo add http://$(oc --context cluster1 -n gogs get route gogs -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/student/federation-dev.git
    ~~~
3. Verify the repository has been loaded into Argo CD 

   ~~~sh
   argocd repo list
    ~~~
4. Create an application that uses the defined git repository

    ~~~sh
    argocd app create --project default --name rhte-simple-app --repo http://$(oc --context cluster1 -n gogs get route gogs -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/student/federation-dev.git --path labs/lab-4-assets --dest-server $(argocd cluster list | grep cluster1 | awk '{print $1}') --dest-namespace simple-app --revision master
    ~~~
5. List the newly defined app. An important thing to notice is that the application will have a status of *OutOfSync* (It might take some time to show up under Health column)

    ~~~sh
    argocd app list
    ~~~
6. Force a sync of the application. This will provide a detail read out on the success of the deployment of objects. You should see a value of "Health Status: Healthy" and "Message: successfully synced (all tasks run)".

    ~~~sh
    argocd app sync rhte-simple-app
    ~~~

<a id="markdown-verify-that-the-application-is-running" name="verify-that-the-application-is-running"></a>
## Verify that the application is running

Verify that the various resources have been deployed. 

~~~sh
# The for loop below will display objects in the simple-app namespace
for resource in deployments services pods
do
  echo "------------  ${resource} ------------"
  oc --context cluster1 -n simple-app get $resource
done
~~~

Expose a route to allow for external ingress and verify the application can be queried.

~~~sh
# Expose the route for the httpd service
oc --context=cluster1 -n simple-app expose service httpd
# The helper command `wait-for-deployment` will wait until the Deployment object is in the Ready state
wait-for-deployment cluster1 simple-app httpd
# Get the Route hostname
url="http://$(oc --context=cluster1 -n simple-app get route httpd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
# We will wait 5 seconds to allow for proper propogation
sleep 5
# Access the route
curl -s $url | grep "This page"
~~~

<a id="markdown-state-recovery" name="state-recovery"></a>
## State Recovery

We are going to delete the deployment and watch as Argo CD will notice that the status is *unhealthy* and redeploy the deployment.

~~~sh
# Use the `oc` command to delete the httpd deployment object
oc --context cluster1 -n simple-app delete deployment httpd
~~~

As you can see the deployment is missing.
~~~sh
# Use the `oc` command to list deployments in the simple-app namespace
oc --context cluster1 -n simple-app get deployments
~~~

The deployment is missing so let's check to ensure Argo CD realizes the items are missing.

~~~sh
# Use the `argocd` binary to list application statu
argocd app list

NAME             CLUSTER                                NAMESPACE   PROJECT  STATUS     HEALTH   SYNCPOLICY  CONDITIONS
rhte-simple-app  https://api.cluster1.example.com:6443  simple-app  default  OutOfSync  Missing  <none>      <none>
~~~

Let's force a sync of the application to return the deployment. When runing the sync command notice that the item is missing.
~~~sh
# Use the `argocd` binary to sync the `rhte-simple-app` application
argocd app sync rhte-simple-app

TIMESTAMP                  GROUP                     KIND   NAMESPACE                  NAME    STATUS    HEALTH        HOOK  MESSAGE
2019-08-21T22:16:45-04:00  route.openshift.io       Route  simple-app                 httpd  OutOfSync  Unknown              
2019-08-21T22:16:45-04:00                       Namespace                        simple-app    Synced   Unknown              
2019-08-21T22:16:45-04:00                         Service  simple-app                 httpd    Synced   Healthy              
2019-08-21T22:16:45-04:00   apps               Deployment  simple-app                 httpd  OutOfSync  Missing  
<OUTPUT_OMITTED>     
~~~

After running the sync command `FATA[000X] 1 resources require pruning` will appear in the output this is because the route 
we created within `oc expose` is not stored within the git repo. If auto-pruning was on then the route would be automatically deleted. This error demonstrates the importance of keeping all of the Kubernetes objects within git to ensure that there is no configuration drift.

Verify the deployment is once again present after the synchronization.

~~~sh
# Use the `oc` command to list deployments in the simple-app namespace
oc --context cluster1 -n simple-app get deployments
~~~

## Create the two OpenShift clusters

Follow the [developer preview instructions](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install) for installing two OpenShift 4.1 clusters on AWS.

Once both clusters are up and running, we are going to merge the Kubernetes configurations files so we have a connection to both clusters using the same Kubeconfig file.

## Configure client context for cluster admin access

The installer has created a `kubeconfig` file for each cluster, we are going to merge them in the same file so we can use that file later with `kubefedctl` tool.

First, we will rename the `admin` context and then we will rename the admin user so when we merge the two kubeconfig files both admin users are present.

~~~sh
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/cluster1/kubeconfig
oc config rename-context admin cluster1
sed -i 's/admin/cluster1/g' $KUBECONFIG

export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/cluster2/kubeconfig
oc config rename-context admin cluster2
sed -i 's/admin/cluster2/g' $KUBECONFIG

export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/cluster1/kubeconfig:/path/to/cluster2/kubeconfig
oc config view --flatten > /path/to/composed-kubeconfig

export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/composed-kubeconfig
oc config use-context cluster1
~~~

After this our current client context is `system:admin` in `cluster1`. The
following commands assume this is the active context:

~~~sh
$ oc config current-context
cluster1
$ oc whoami
system:admin
~~~

The presence and unique naming of the client contexts are important because the `kubefedctl` tool uses them to manage cluster registration, and they are referenced by context name.

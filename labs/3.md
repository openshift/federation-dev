## Deploy Federation

Federation target clusters do not require federation to be installed on them at
all, but for convenience, we will use one of the clusters (`cluster1`) to host
the federation control plane.

At the moment, the Federation Operator only works in namespace-scoped mode, in the future cluster-scoped mode will be supported as well by the operator.

In order to deploy the operator, we are going to use `Operator Hub` within the OCP4 WebUI.

1. Login into `cluster1` web console as `kubeadmin` user
   1. Login details were reported by the installer
2. Create the namespace to be federated
   1. On the left panel click `Home -> Projects`
   2. Click `Create Project`
   3. Name it `test-namespace`
   4. Click `Create`
3. Install Federation from `Operator Hub`
   1. On the left panel click `Catalog -> Operator Hub`
   2. Select `Federation` from operator list
   3. If a warning about use of Community Operators is shown click `Continue`
   4. Click `Install`
   5. Make sure `test-namespace` is selected as destination namespace
   6. Click `Subscribe`
4. Check the Operator Subscription status
   1. On the left panel click `Catalog -> Operator Management`
   2. Click `Operator Subscriptions` tab
   3. Ensure the `Status` is "Up to date" for the `federation` subscription

If everything is okay, we should have the federation controller running in the namespace  `test-namespace`.

~~~sh
oc --context=cluster1 -n test-namespace get pods

NAME                                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
federation-controller-manager-744f57ccff-q4f6k  1/1       Running   0          3m18s
~~~

Now we are going to enable some of the federated types needed for our demo application

~~~sh
for type in namespaces secrets serviceaccounts services configmaps deployments.apps
do
    kubefedctl enable $type --federation-namespace test-namespace
done

## Register the clusters

Verify that there are no clusters yet (but note
that you can already reference the CRDs for federated clusters):

~~~sh
oc get federatedclusters -n test-namespace

No resources found.
~~~

Now use the `kubefedctl` tool to register (*join*) the two clusters:

~~~sh
kubefedctl join cluster1 \
            --host-cluster-context cluster1 \
            --cluster-context cluster1 \
            --add-to-registry \
            --v=2 \
            --federation-namespace=test-namespace
kubefedctl join cluster2 \
            --host-cluster-context cluster1 \
            --cluster-context cluster2 \
            --add-to-registry \
            --v=2 \
            --federation-namespace=test-namespace
~~~

Note that the names of the clusters (`cluster1` and `cluster2`) in the commands above are a reference to the contexts configured in the `oc` client. For this process to work as expected you need to make sure that the [client contexts](#configure-client-context-for-cluster-admin-access) have been properly configured with the right access levels and context names. The `--cluster-context` option for `kubefedctl join` can be used to override the reference to the client context configuration. When the option is not present, `kubefedctl` uses the cluster name to identify the client context.

Verify that the federated clusters are registered and in a ready state (this
can take a moment):

~~~sh
oc describe federatedclusters -n test-namespace

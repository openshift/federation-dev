# Introduction

This demo is a simple deployment of the [KubeFed
Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/kubefed-operator) on two OpenShift
clusters. A sample application is deployed to both clusters through the
KubeFed controller.

<a id="markdown-pre-requisites" name="pre-requisites"></a>
# Prerequisites

The Federation Operator requires at least one [OpenShift Container
Platform](https://www.openshift.com/) 4.1 cluster.

This walkthrough will use two OCP 4.1 clusters deployed using the
[Installer-Provisioned
Infrastructure](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws) installation
type.

<a id="markdown-install-the-kubefedctl-binary" name="install-the-kubefedctl-binary"></a>
## Install the kubefedctl binary

The `kubefedctl` tool manages federated cluster registration. Download the
v0.1.0-rc3 release and unpack it into a directory in your PATH (the
example uses `$HOME/bin`):

~~~sh
curl -Ls https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/releases/download/v0.1.0-rc3/kubefedctl-0.1.0-rc3-linux-amd64.tgz | tar xz -C ~/bin
~~~

Verify that `kubefedctl` is working:

~~~sh
kubefedctl version

kubefedctl version: version.Info{Version:"v0.1.0-rc3", GitCommit:"d188d227fe3f78f33d74d9a40b3cb701c471cc7e", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-06-25T00:27:58Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
~~~

<a id="markdown-download-the-example-code" name="download-the-example-code"></a>
## Download the example code

Clone the demo code to your local machine:

~~~sh
git clone https://github.com/openshift/federation-dev.git
cd federation-dev/
~~~

# Federation deployment

<a id="markdown-create-the-two-openshift-clusters" name="create-the-two-openshift-clusters"></a>
## Create the two OpenShift clusters

Follow the [Installer Provisioned Infrastructure
Instructions](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned)
for installing two OpenShift 4.1 clusters on AWS. Be sure to employ the `--dir`
option with a distinct directory for each cluster you create.

<a id="markdown-configure-client-context-for-cluster-admin-access" name="configure-client-context-for-cluster-admin-access"></a>
## Configure client context for cluster admin access

The installer creates a `kubeconfig` file for each cluster. We are going to
merge them in the same file so we can use that file later with the `kubefedctl`
tool. As an example, if you use the `--dir` option to create cluster1 within a
directory called `cluster1`, the kubeconfig will be in
`cluster1/admin/kubeconfig`. See also [our
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuh3JFtNbeU) outlining the process of
combining kubeconfigs.

First, we will rename the `admin` context and credentials of each cluster, then
merge the two kubeconfig files.

~~~sh
sed -i 's/admin/cluster1/g' cluster1/auth/kubeconfig

sed -i 's/admin/cluster2/g' cluster2/auth/kubeconfig

export KUBECONFIG=cluster1/auth/kubeconfig:cluster2/auth/kubeconfig

oc config view --flatten > /path/to/composed-kubeconfig

export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/composed-kubeconfig
oc config use-context cluster1
~~~

Now, our current client context is `system:admin` in `cluster1`. The
following commands assume this is the active context:

~~~sh
$ oc config current-context
cluster1
$ oc whoami
system:admin
~~~

The presence and unique naming of the client contexts are important because the
`kubefedctl` tool uses them to manage cluster registration, and they are
referenced by context name.

<a id="markdown-deploy-kubefed" name="deploy-kubefed"></a>

## Deploy KubeFed

Federation member clusters do not require KubeFed to be installed on them, but
for convenience, we will use one of the clusters (`cluster1`) to host
the KubeFed control plane.

In order to deploy the operator, we are going to use `Operator Hub` within the OCP4 Web Console.

KubeFed supports two modes of operation: namespace scoped and cluster scoped.
This guide will walk through installing namespace scoped KubeFed.
For a cluster-scoped guide, [click here](ocp4-cluster-scoped.md)

A note on namespaces: The KubeFed operator install provides an option to either
limit the operator to watch a particular namespace or watch all namespaces
cluster-wide (default). This is a different concept from KubeFed itself being
either namespace or cluster scoped. In order to deploy namespace scoped KubeFed,
you will install the operator to watch all namespaces, the default mode.

1. Login into `cluster1` web console as `kubeadmin` user.
   1. Login details are reported by the installer and the password is peristed in the file `auth/kubeadmin-password`.
2. Create the namespace (OpenShift project) to be federated.
   1. On the left panel click `Home -> Projects`.
   2. Click `Create Project`.
   3. Name it `test-namespace`.
   4. Click `Create`.
3. Install KubeFed from `Operator Hub`.
   1. On the left panel click `Catalog -> Operator Hub`.
   2. Select `KubeFed` from operator list.
   3. If a warning about use of Community Operators is shown click `Continue`.
   4. Click `Install`.
   5. Under `Installation Mode`, ensure `All namespaces on the cluster (default)` is selected.
   6. Click `Subscribe`.
4. Check the Operator Subscription status.
   1. On the left panel click `Catalog -> Operator Management`.
   2. Click `Operator Subscriptions` tab.
   3. Ensure the `Status` is "Up to date" for the `kubefed-operator` subscription.
   4. Note the namespace the operator has installed into is openshift-operators
5. Create a KubeFed resource to instantiate the KubeFed controller.
   1. On the left panel click `Catalog -> Installed Operators`.
   2. Select `test-namespace` from the drop down list for Project
   3. Click `Kubefed Operator`.
   4. Under `Provided APIs`, find `KubeFed`, and click `Create New`.
   5. Ensure the namespace is `test-namespace` and the scope is `Namespaced` then click `Create`.

If everything works as expected, there should be a kubefed-controller-manager
Deployment with two pods running in `test-namespace`.

~~~sh
oc --context=cluster1 -n test-namespace get pods

NAME                                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubefed-controller-manager-744f57ccff-q4f6k  1/1       Running   0          3m18s
kubefed-controller-manager-744f57ccff-2jb6b  1/1       Running   0          3m18s
~~~

### Troubleshooting the operator
*Note:* There is an issue in the latest version of the operator (as of this writing) where the operator does not properly listen to all namespaces. If, after creating a KubeFed resource, the kubefed-controller-manager deployment is not created in the test namespace, try the following:

1. In the WebUI, on the left panel click `Catalog -> Installed Operators`.
2. Select `Openshift Operators` from the `Projects` drop down list.
3. Click `KubeFed Operator`.
4. Click `YAML` to enter the editor for the CSV YAML content.
5. Find the string `WATCH_NAMESPACE`
6. Ensure `fieldPath` is set to `metadata.annotations['olm.targetNamespaces']`.
7. Click `Save` to push the update to the operator.

Now we are going to enable some of the federated types needed for our demo application. You can watch as FederatedTypeConfig resources are created for each type by visiting the `All Instances` tab of the `Kubefed Operator` under `Catalog -> Installed Operators`.

~~~sh
for type in namespaces secrets serviceaccounts services configmaps deployments.apps
do
    kubefedctl enable $type --kubefed-namespace test-namespace 
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-register-the-clusters" name="register-the-clusters"></a>
## Register the clusters

Verify that there are no clusters yet (but note
that you can already reference the CRDs for federated clusters):

~~~sh
oc get kubefedclusters -n test-namespace

No resources found.
~~~

Now use the `kubefedctl` tool to register (*join*) the two clusters:

~~~sh
kubefedctl join cluster1 \
            --host-cluster-context cluster1 \
            --cluster-context cluster1 \
            --kubefed-namespace=test-namespace \
            --v=2
kubefedctl join cluster2 \
            --host-cluster-context cluster1 \
            --cluster-context cluster2 \
            --kubefed-namespace=test-namespace \
            --v=2
~~~

Note that the names of the clusters (`cluster1` and `cluster2`) in the commands
above are a reference to the contexts configured in the `oc` client. For this
process to work as expected you need to make sure that the [client
contexts](#configure-client-context-for-cluster-admin-access) have been
properly configured with the right access levels and context names. The
`--cluster-context` option for `kubefedctl join` can be used to override the
reference to the client context configuration. When the option is not present,
`kubefedctl` uses the cluster name to identify the client context.

Verify that the federated clusters are registered and in a ready state (this
can take a moment):

~~~sh
oc describe kubefedclusters -n test-namespace

<a id="markdown-example-application" name="example-application"></a>
# Example application

Now that we have kubefed installed, letâ€™s deploy an example app in both
clusters through the kubefed control plane.

Verify that our test-namespace is present in both clusters now:

~~~sh
oc --context=cluster1 get ns | grep test-namespace
oc --context=cluster2 get ns | grep test-namespace

test-namespace                 Active    36m
test-namespace                 Active    3m21s
~~~

The container image we will use for our example application (nginx) requires the
ability to choose its user id. Configure the clusters to grant that privilege:

~~~sh
for c in cluster1 cluster2; do
    oc --context ${c} \
        adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid \
        system:serviceaccount:test-namespace:default
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-deploy-the-application" name="deploy-the-application"></a>
## Deploy the application

The sample application includes the following resources:

-   A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) of an nginx web server.
-   A [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) of type NodePort for nginx.
-   A sample [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/), [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) and [ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/). These are not actually used by
    the sample application (static nginx) but are included to illustrate how
    Kubefed would assist with more complex applications.

The [sample-app directory](./sample-app) contains definitions to deploy these resources. For each of them there is a resource template and a placement policy, and some of
them also have overrides. For example: the [sample nginx deployment template](./sample-app/federateddeployment.yaml)
specifies 3 replicas, but there is also an override that sets the replicas to 5
on `cluster2`.

Instantiate all these federated resources:

~~~sh
oc apply -R -f sample-app
~~~

<a id="markdown-verify-that-the-application-is-running" name="verify-that-the-application-is-running"></a>
## Verify that the application is running

Verify that the various resources have been deployed in both clusters according
to their respective placement policies and cluster overrides:

~~~sh
for resource in configmaps secrets deployments services; do
    for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
        echo ------------ ${cluster} ${resource} ------------
        oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get ${resource}
    done
done
~~~

Verify that the application can be accessed:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
  echo ------------ ${cluster} ------------
  oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace expose service test-service
  url="http://$(oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get route test-service -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
  curl -I $url
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-modify-placement" name="modify-placement"></a>
## Modify placement

Now modify the `test-deployment` federated deployment placement policy to remove `cluster2`, leaving it
only active on `cluster1`:

~~~sh
oc -n test-namespace patch federateddeployment test-deployment \
    --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"placement":{"clusters":[{"name": "cluster1"}]}}}'
~~~

Observe how the federated deployment is now only present in `cluster1`:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
    echo ------------ ${cluster} deployments ------------
    oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get deployments
done
~~~

Now add `cluster2` back to the federated deployment placement:

~~~sh
oc -n test-namespace patch federateddeployment test-deployment \
    --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"placement":{"clusters": [{"name": "cluster1"}, {"name": "cluster2"}]}}}'
~~~

And verify that the federated deployment was deployed on both clusters again:

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
    echo ------------ ${cluster} deployments ------------
    oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace get deployments
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-clean-up" name="clean-up"></a>
# Clean up

To clean up the test application run:

~~~sh
oc delete -R -f sample-app
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2; do
  oc --context=${cluster} -n test-namespace delete route test-service
done
~~~

This leaves the two clusters with federation deployed. If you want to disable federation:

1. Login into `cluster1` web console as `kubeadmin` user
   1. Login details were reported by the installer
2. Ensure the active project is `test-namespace`
3. Delete the CVS (Cluster Service Version)
   1. On the left panel click `Catalog -> Installed Operators`
   2. Click the three dots icon on the federation entry
   3. Click `Delete Cluster Service Version`

<a id="markdown-whats-next" name="whats-next"></a>
# Whatâ€™s next?

This walkthrough does not go into detail about the components and resources involved
in cluster federation. Feel free to explore the repository to review the YAML files
that configure KubeFed and deploy the sample application. See also the upstream
KubeFed repository and its [user guide](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/userguide.md), on which this guide is based.

Beyond that: More advanced aspects of cluster federation
like managing ingress traffic or storage rely on supporting infrastructure for
the clusters will be topics for more advanced guides.
